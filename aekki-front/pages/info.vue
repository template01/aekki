      </p>

      We accept all major Credit Cards and PayPal (using Stripe as our payment service provider). If you need assistance during the transaction, please don't hesitate to contact us collection@Aekki.nl

      Aekki offers worldwide shipping. We use PostNL the most well-known Dutch postal company for our packages.

    Shipping
</p>


      We offer two shipping rates: with and without insurance and Track&Trace service. If you want your shipping costs to be as low as possible, meaning that Aekki is not responsible for lost or damaged packages, you can use one of the following options:

      10-50 gr Netherlands € 1.42
      10-50 gr international € 2,50

      50-250 gr Netherlands € 2,92
      50-250 gr international € 6,25

      You can also choose to have your package insured (up to € 500) including a Track&Trace number:

      Up to 2kg € 6,95 (Netherlands)
      Up to 2kg € 25,95 (International)

      For 2+ kg or custom items shipping rates will depend on the specific package.

      We try to ship all items within 5 working days, but since we are a small studio delays can occur once in a while. Aekki is located in the Netherlands. Shipping within Europe normally takes 5-8 working days. Shipping to the USA and other countries outside Europe takes approximately 1-2 weeks.

  Packaging
</p>
      We hope that our packages will feel like a birthday present so we take great care in preparing your orders. We try to keep our packaging to a minimum and only use recyclable materials.

      By the way did you know that all the tees are hand ironed before packing?
